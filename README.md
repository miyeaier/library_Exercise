# The code
The library_challenge is a simple ruby based project, 
In order to produce good quality code,
we work in a test driven way and unit test this coade According to the requirements and logical needs set by the course material we need to have a Library,
 Book and a Visitor, so we write the code based on these（Library/Book/Visitor) three classes to complete the whole project.

# Dependencies
Game framework we used Rspec for unit test

# Setup
We’ll be write our application using Test Driven Development(RSpec),
In order to be able to use it we need to install it.
There are two ways to install libraries (gems). 
A direct install from your terminal(gem install rspec) .$ gem install bundler or by adding a gem as a dependency to your application using Bundler ,
you just add a gem to a specific file named Gemfile. And run bundle install again. The next step is to initialize RSpec and configure it for our needs. 
.$ rspec --init Edit the .rspec file and add --format documentation to see a more verbose rspec output.
 .rspec file needs to look like this. --format documentation --color --require spec_helper
